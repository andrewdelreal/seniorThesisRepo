## Week 1 Summary (09/15/2025)

### This week I worked on:

Looking for different project ideas for my senior project.

### This week I learned:

I explored project ideas like a different minesweeper game, a tennis related professional stats visualizer, and a stock portfolio manager.

### My successes this week were:

I was able to find different resources and ideas of projects that I was interested in.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

It is hard to find a project to work on.

## Week 2 Summary (09/22/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Finializing an idea for my senior project. I will be making a stock portfolio related application and trying to make it more insightful for users.

### This week I learned:

About some of the framework to use for my project, like ReactNative, a backend database like SQlite to hold user portfolio data, and the API/s that I will be using to pull stock data from.

### My successes this week were:

Finding the right framework and materials to use.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Finding the right API was pretty challenging. I took quite a bit of research to find the right one for what I want to accomplish in the app.

---

## Week 3 Summary (09/29/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Finding use cases for my project.

### This week I learned:

What my use cases will be, but also what I need to ammend/change to my use cases.

### My successes this week were:

Making the use cases and having a good idea for what I can do to start my project, specifically with the setup stuff, like with logins and starting to be able to pull data from the API.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Finding the right use cases was challenging, especially with trying to incorporate machine learning into the application. I need to revise what I want to accomplish with machine learning to be something much more reasonable and specific.

## Week 4 Summary (10/06/2025)
### This week I worked on:

I have a modified version of how I want to use Machine Learning. So I found a few things I can do to narrow my scope of my machine learning.

### This week I learned:

Some of the more narrow tasks that are much more feasable are whether a stock will close higher tommorrow than yesterday, clustering stocks to help with diversification, and maybe ranking stocks (out of a group of n stocks, which k are most likely to do best) So I won't be trying to beat the game, just try and add a little more insight into a stock.

### My successes this week were:

Narrowing the machine learning scope.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Trying to narrow down the machine learning aspect of the project has been tricky.

---

## Week 5 Summary (10/13/2025)
### This week I worked on:

My elevator pitch and starting to get ready for the first sprint.

### This week I learned:

What I want to include for my clustering use case.

### My successes this week were:

Being able make the pitch but also fixing my use cases to be more descriptive with the clustering
I plan to do.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Nothing really

## Week 6 Summary (10/20/2025)
### This week I worked on:

I started looking into the setup of the project and looking into how I can make an IOS application

### This week I learned:

I learned it is very hard to try and make an IOS app and not free if I don't have a mac. I may 

### My successes this week were:

I learned more about my setp, but also learned that I may need to change my technologies I plan to use.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Using the IOS software is a pain and it seems to be hard to develop with.

---

## Week 7 Summary (10/27/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Making a Web application for my Stock Learning Web App. I changed the scope of my project (with Dr. Mahoney's approval). I started with the basic front and backend. Once I got most of the boiler plate code for my front and backend, I completed the first use case of my project, logging in with Google's OAuth.

### This week I learned:

How to use Google OAuth but also how to tie it in with typescript

### My successes this week were:

Finally getting to really start with programming. After the hastle of trying to use an IOS app, it feels good to be able to program more than just setup.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Google OAuth was a bit challenging to get working, mainly with linking the client ID (the app's id to talk to OAuth).
