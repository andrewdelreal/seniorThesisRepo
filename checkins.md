## Week 1 Summary (09/15/2025)

### This week I worked on:

Looking for different project ideas for my senior project.

### This week I learned:

I explored project ideas like a different minesweeper game, a tennis related professional stats visualizer, and a stock portfolio manager.

### My successes this week were:

I was able to find different resources and ideas of projects that I was interested in.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

It is hard to find a project to work on.

## Week 2 Summary (09/22/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Finializing an idea for my senior project. I will be making a stock portfolio related application and trying to make it more insightful for users.

### This week I learned:

About some of the framework to use for my project, like ReactNative, a backend database like SQlite to hold user portfolio data, and the API/s that I will be using to pull stock data from.

### My successes this week were:

Finding the right framework and materials to use.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Finding the right API was pretty challenging. I took quite a bit of research to find the right one for what I want to accomplish in the app.

## Week 3 Summary (09/29/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Finding use cases for my project.

### This week I learned:

What my use cases will be, but also what I need to ammend/change to my use cases.

### My successes this week were:

Making the use cases and having a good idea for what I can do to start my project, specifically with the setup stuff, like with logins and starting to be able to pull data from the API.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Finding the right use cases was challenging, especially with trying to incorporate machine learning into the application. I need to revise what I want to accomplish with machine learning to be something much more reasonable and specific.

## Week 4 Summary (10/06/2025)
### This week I worked on:

I have a modified version of how I want to use Machine Learning. So I found a few things I can do to narrow my scope of my machine learning.

### This week I learned:

Some of the more narrow tasks that are much more feasable are whether a stock will close higher tommorrow than yesterday, clustering stocks to help with diversification, and maybe ranking stocks (out of a group of n stocks, which k are most likely to do best) So I won't be trying to beat the game, just try and add a little more insight into a stock.

### My successes this week were:

Narrowing the machine learning scope.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Trying to narrow down the machine learning aspect of the project has been tricky.
